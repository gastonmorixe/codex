Started git maintenance: fetch upstream, rebase on upstream/main, fix conflicts, build.
Steps: check remotes/branch, fetch, rebase, resolve, build.
Rebasing onto origin/main as upstream per user instruction.

- Rebase started; conflicts in cli/Cargo.toml, core/src/codex.rs, tui/src/lib.rs. Inspecting.

Continuing rebase with editor disabled to avoid hangs.

Rebase continued and resolved further conflicts by preferring origin/main.
Fixed build issues in TUI: add uuid dep, switch dirs_next->dirs, import GitInfo from protocol, fix SessionStateSnapshot path, set cwd: Some(meta.cwd).
Added missing mod session_title; in tui/src/lib.rs.

cargo build --workspace succeeded after fixes.
