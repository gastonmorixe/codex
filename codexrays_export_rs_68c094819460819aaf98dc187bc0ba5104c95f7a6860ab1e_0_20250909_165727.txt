**Analyzing file tracking during rebase**

I need to figure out what happened with the files PR_WORK_PROGRESS_NOTES.md and WORK.md. The user said that during a rebase, the output showed them as untracked files. Then later, I saw "26 files changed" which indicated these files were added as created mode. It seems that during the rebase, these files got included in a commit. They likely were untracked before, but somehow became part of the commit due to how patches were applied.**Explaining file tracking during git operations**

It looks like "create mode 100644 WORK.md" indicates that the commit we rebased included that file. It's possible that untracked files were added when I ran "git add -A," which stages everything, including untracked files like WORK.md and PR_WORK_PROGRESS_NOTES.md. My earlier action is likely the reason they got included during the rebase. 

I should apologize and suggest removing these files from the current branch history. I'll explain that they were originally untracked but became tracked because of how I resolved conflicts.**Proposing options for commit cleanup**

Iâ€™m considering options for handling untracked files in commits. I could suggest either removing the files and amending the commit or creating a cleanup commit. To avoid opening an editor, I might use "git restore --staged" or "git rm --cached" followed by "git commit --amend --no-edit." The user mentioned that GPG signing is okay if triggered. 

I should also check if these files were present in an earlier commit than HEAD, since they were created during the application of a commit in the rebase series.**Considering options for file removal**

To remove the files from the commit history, I can run "git rm --cached WORK.md codex-rs/PR_WORK_PROGRESS_NOTES.md" and then create a new commit to exclude them. Alternatively, I could rebase again to edit the previous commit and remove these files. However, if the user prefers not to track these files at all, they might need to be added to .gitignore. I should check if those patterns are already included in .gitignore by searching through it.
